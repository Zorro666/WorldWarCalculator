Some way to format value for defence or income buildings (multiplier)
Per row show: reward, current cost, base cost
Put +/- buttons UI system in place for number
Scrolling view (vertical & horizontal)
Fix edit text hassle on the number box which goes big and small
Display image of building
Really sounds like income & defence should have a derived class to set some defaults in them
