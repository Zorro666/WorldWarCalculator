ui: make +/- buttons look nicer - make custom image
app: update the costs to match the new costs
app: add an icon :)
ui: make +/- buttons : UI display like buttons with down & up states
app: add support for the left button (options) - pop-up menu "Save", "Quit"

app tab: dialog if save fails - NEEDS TESTING
app tab: dialog if delete fails - NEEDS TESTING
profile tab: copy button shouldn't save & reload just to get the old profile back in the list - do a proper copy - NEEDS TESTING
profile tab: implement the rename button - NEEDS TESTING

app tab: backup/restore info dialogs could show how many profiles restored/saved
app: use SharedPrefences system to store the app state
app: only save changed data to the bundle
app: sort out the life cycle state saving - use onSave, onRestore bundles instead of files

linked header row: connect header row scrolling to the main view?
linked header row: working quite well - perhaps try to capture fling events?

profile tab: need button to load profile - would reload to undo changes - needs a confirmation box first

ui: make UI look nicer - colour scheme ideas?

java: unify the Income & Defence buildings list into a single collection which can be iterated over in WWProfile (perhaps with IF to get by type)
java: unify the profile class - have a single class for type of building - then the profile can just have "incomeProfile", "defenceProfile"
java: the building static info should be ptrs or refs not copied into every profile entry and every profile
tabs: edit tab widget - add another text field? - make image smaller?
annoyance: the number text is getting left with the red text value - it is android doing it - leaving the text as highlighted!!!!

onPause - save to disk
onDestroy -> isFinishing() = user quit else system freeing up resources
onSaveInstance() - called just before on pause -> takes Bundle object
onRestoreInstance() - called after onStart() takes the bundle created by onSaveInstance() but also onCreate() takes the bundle

onCreate = only called when activity is first created
onRestart -> load from disk -> onStart
onRestoreInstance() -> restore from bundle = deltas on top of disk data
onStart = do loading if not restored from bundle
-> onResume -> live with the user
-> onSaveInstance() -> onPause -> save memory data to bundle
onStop() -> not visible to user -> save to disk
-> onRestart() - becomes visible again
-> onDestroy()
onDestroy() -> isFinishing() if user quit e.g. back button
