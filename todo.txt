app: sort out the life cycle state saving - use onSave, onRestore bundles instead of files
linked header row: connect header row scrolling to the main view?
linked header row: working quite well - perhaps try to capture fling events?
building tab: show num to buy next to the buildings (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,9+)
income tab: show num to buy next to the buildings (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,9+)
annoyance: the number text is getting left with the red text value - it is android doing it - leaving the text as highlighted!!!!
profile tab: need button to load profile - would reload to undo changes - needs a confirmation box first
profile tab: delete profile should ask yes/no
profile tab: save profile should say "saved:ok" confirmation box
ui: make +/- buttons look nicer
ui: make +/- buttons : UI display like buttons with down & up states
ui: make UI look nicer - colour scheme ideas?
profile tab: what should the hint be (needs saving?)
hint tab: show hint data - how many of the best buildings to buy (sorted list) - with cost for the hint
app: add an icon :)
java: unify the Income & Defence buildings list into a single collection which can be iterated over in WWProfile (perhaps with IF to get by type)
java: unify the profile class - have a single class for type of building - then the profile can just have "incomeProfile", "defenceProfile"
