bug: the number text is getting left with the red text value - it is android doing it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bug: enter number - switch app the new number is not saved
put the header row in the table - to stop the confusion and out of sync scrolling issues
sort out the life cycle state saving - use onSave, onRestore bundles instead of files
display numbers as 340M or 18K if exact multiples can be found
building tab - show num to buy next to the buildings (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,9+)
income tab - show num to buy next to the buildings (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,9+)
profile tab - need a copy profile button
profile tab - need button to load profile - would reload to undo changes - needs a confirmation box first
profile tab - delete profile should ask yes/no
profile tab - save profile should say "saved:ok" confirmation box
make +/- buttons look nicer
make UI look nicer - ?????
profile tab : what should the hint be (needs saving?)
hint tab - show hint data - how many of the best buildings to buy (sorted list) - with cost for the hint
add an icon for the app :)
Try to get a header row working - with linked scrolling
unify the Income & Defence buildings list into a single collection which can be iterated over in WWProfile (perhaps with IF to get by type)
unify the profile class - have a single class for type of building - then the profile can just have "incomeProfile", "defenceProfile"
