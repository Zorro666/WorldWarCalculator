linked header row: working quite well - perhaps try to capture fling events?
linked header row: disable manual scrolling of the header row
bug: profile rename + save = wrong profile being displayed
bug: profile rename = copy when you restart the app
profile tab - need a copy profile button
linked header row: connect header row scrolling to the main view?
sort out the life cycle state saving - use onSave, onRestore bundles instead of files
display numbers as 340M or 18K if exact multiples can be found
building tab - show num to buy next to the buildings (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,9+)
income tab - show num to buy next to the buildings (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,9+)
annoyance: the number text is getting left with the red text value - it is android doing it - leaving the text as highlighted!!!!
profile tab - need button to load profile - would reload to undo changes - needs a confirmation box first
profile tab - delete profile should ask yes/no
profile tab - save profile should say "saved:ok" confirmation box
make +/- buttons look nicer
make UI look nicer - ?????
profile tab : what should the hint be (needs saving?)
hint tab - show hint data - how many of the best buildings to buy (sorted list) - with cost for the hint
add an icon for the app :)
unify the Income & Defence buildings list into a single collection which can be iterated over in WWProfile (perhaps with IF to get by type)
unify the profile class - have a single class for type of building - then the profile can just have "incomeProfile", "defenceProfile"
