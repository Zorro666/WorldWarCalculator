Put the second best building to buy on the hint display
Highlight the best buy building row : BOLD and Red
sort out the life cycle state saving - use onSave, onRestore bundles instead of files
put the header row in the table - to stop the confusion and out of sync scrolling issues
bug: switching apps might lose the profile name and be working with the default profile?
bug: enter number - switch app the new number is not saved
all tabs - put best hint to the right of the "profile drop down" ? (num to buy)
make the UI buttons bigger
display numbers as 340M or 18K if exact multiples can be found
building tab - show num to buy next to the buildings (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,9+)
income tab - show num to buy next to the buildings (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,9+)
all tabs - put best n hints (2 or 3) to the right of the "profile drop down" ?
hint tab - show hint data - how many of the best buildings to buy (sorted list)
all tabs - put a profile save button next to the profile dropdown?
Try to get a header row working - with linked scrolling
profile tab - need button to load profile - would reload to undo changes - needs a confirmation box first
profile tab - delete profile should ask yes/no
profile tab - save profile should say "saved:ok" confirmation box
unify the Income & Defence buildings list into a single collection which can be iterated over in WWProfile (perhaps with IF to get by type)
make UI look nicer - ?????
make +/- buttons look nicer
use proper android bundle for save/restore - sharedstatebundle?????
hint text - on the profile tab - what should the hint be (needs saving?)
add an icon for the app :)
