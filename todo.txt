Build Building Rows in code from income & defence arrays
Use TAG object to point to link the different view elements together (perhaps an ArrayAdapter and list scroll?))
Fix edit text hassle on the number box which goes big and small
Put +/- buttons UI system in place for number
Scrolling view (vertical & horizontal)
Display image of building
Per row show: name, number, value, reward, current cost, base cost
Some way to format value for defence or income buildings (multiplier)
Really sounds like income & defence should have a derived class to set some defaults in them
