Really sounds like income & defence should have a derived class to set some defaults in them and make profiles/UI interaction neater
add all profiles to a drop down list
add ability to rename current profile (double click on the current profile name)
capture out of memory event - save current active profile (state data)
capture close activity event - save the current profile
make UI look nicer - smaller font
THEN IT WILL BE USEFUL - USE IT - TEST IT OUT - SHOW IT/GIVE IT TO SAM
Put +/- buttons UI system in place for number
Make best buy BOLD and Green - flashing ?
show hint data (new tab?) - how many of the best buildings to buy (sorted list)
Try to get a header row working - with linked scrolling
Display image of building
need button to load profile - would reload to undo changes
