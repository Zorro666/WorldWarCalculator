app tab: should restore wipe local data and replace with the restored version?
profile tab: copy button don't save & reload just to get the old profile back in the list - do a proper copy - NEEDS TESTING
profile tab: implement the rename button
app: update the costs to match the new costs
app: use SharedPrefences system to store the app state
app: only save changed data to the bundle
app: sort out the life cycle state saving - use onSave, onRestore bundles instead of files
linked header row: connect header row scrolling to the main view?
linked header row: working quite well - perhaps try to capture fling events?
building tab: show num to buy next to the buildings (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,9+)
income tab: show num to buy next to the buildings (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,9+)
annoyance: the number text is getting left with the red text value - it is android doing it - leaving the text as highlighted!!!!
profile tab: need button to load profile - would reload to undo changes - needs a confirmation box first
profile tab: delete profile should ask yes/no
profile tab: save profile should say "saved:ok" confirmation box
ui: make +/- buttons : UI display like buttons with down & up states
ui: make +/- buttons look nicer
ui: make UI look nicer - colour scheme ideas?
hint tab: show hint data - how many of the best buildings to buy (sorted list) - with cost for the hint
app: add an icon :)
java: unify the Income & Defence buildings list into a single collection which can be iterated over in WWProfile (perhaps with IF to get by type)
java: unify the profile class - have a single class for type of building - then the profile can just have "incomeProfile", "defenceProfile"
java: the building static info should be ptrs or refs not copied into every profile entry and every profile
tabs: edit tab widget - add another text field? - make image smaller?

onPause - save to disk
onDestroy -> isFinishing() = user quit else system freeing up resources
onSaveInstance() - called just before on pause -> takes Bundle object
onRestoreInstance() - called after onStart() takes the bundle created by onSaveInstance() but also onCreate() takes the bundle

onCreate = only called when activity is first created
onRestart -> load from disk -> onStart
onRestoreInstance() -> restore from bundle = deltas on top of disk data
onStart = do loading if not restored from bundle
-> onResume -> live with the user
-> onSaveInstance() -> onPause -> save memory data to bundle
onStop() -> not visible to user -> save to disk
-> onRestart() - becomes visible again
-> onDestroy()
onDestroy() -> isFinishing() if user quit e.g. back button
